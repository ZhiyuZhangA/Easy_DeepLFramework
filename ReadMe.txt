# Easy Deep Learning Framework
This is a deep learning framework made completely in C++ without other libraries.
Currently only support neural network training with linear layers and several non-linear layers
It is still in development and optimization, and will support CUDA acceleration in the future!

Dataset support:
Boston Housing
Mnist

Future Added:
CIFAR-10
CIFAR-100
ImageNet
